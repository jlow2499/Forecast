###1 Naive forecasting methods

# Use naive() to forecast the goog series
fcgoog <- naive(goog, h=20)

# Plot and summarize the forecasts
autoplot(fcgoog)
summary(fcgoog)

# Use snaive() to forecast the ausbeer series
fcbeer <- snaive(ausbeer,h=16)

# Plot and summarize the forecasts
autoplot(fcbeer)
summary(fcbeer)

###3 Checking time series residuals

# Check the residuals from the naive forecasts applied to the goog series
goog %>% naive() %>% checkresiduals()

# Do they look like white noise (TRUE or FALSE)
googwn <- TRUE

# Check the residuals from the seasonal naive forecasts applied to the ausbeer series
ausbeer %>% snaive() %>% checkresiduals()

# Do they look like white noise (TRUE or FALSE)
beerwn <- FALSE

###4 Evaluating forecast accuracy of non-seasonal methods

# Create the training data as train
train <- subset.ts(gold, end = 1000)

# Compute naive forecasts and save to naive_fc
naive_fc <- naive(train, h = 108)

# Compute mean forecasts and save to mean_fc
mean_fc <- meanf(train, h = 108)

# Use accuracy() to compute RMSE statistics
accuracy(naive_fc, gold)
accuracy(mean_fc, gold)

# Assign one of the two forecasts as bestforecasts
bestforecasts <- naive_fc

###5 Evaluating forecast accuracy of seasonal methods

# Create three training series omitting the last 1, 2, and 3 years
train1 <- window(vn[, "Melbourne"], end = c(2014, 4))
train2 <- window(vn[, "Melbourne"], end = c(2013, 4))
train3 <- window(vn[, "Melbourne"], end = c(2012, 4))

# Produce forecasts using snaive()
fc1 <- snaive(train1, h = 4)
fc2 <- snaive(train2, h = 4)
fc3 <- snaive(train3, h = 4)

# Use accuracy() to compare the MAPE of each series
accuracy(fc1, vn[, "Melbourne"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
accuracy(fc2, vn[, "Melbourne"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
accuracy(fc3, vn[, "Melbourne"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
